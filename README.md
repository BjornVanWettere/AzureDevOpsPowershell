# VSTS Powershell
A selection of PowerShell scripts that make use of the TFS/VSTS APIs, both the older .NET and Java ones and the prefered current REST API

I had intended, going forward, to place all the code samples in use in blog posts here. However I have since found it eaiser to use [Gists](https://gist.github.com/rfennell)

There is more in the repo, as it is a bit of a catch all, but the items linked to from posts are as follows
