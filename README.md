# VSTS Powershell
A selection of PowerShell scripts that make use of the TFS/VSTS APIs, both the older .NET and Java ones and the prefered current REST API

Going forward I will place all the code samples in use in blog posts here.

### .NET API
* Scripts to assist in the migration between TFS instances [as detailed in this post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/developers/articles/week03aug14/migrating-a-tfs-tfvc-based-team-project-to-a-git-team-project/)

### REST API
* REST versions of scripts to assist in the migration between TFS instances [as detailed in this post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/developers/articles/week03aug14/migrating-a-tfs-tfvc-based-team-project-to-a-git-team-project/)
* Script to create a standard set of tasks for backlog items in an iteration
* Script to create releases notes for a build in markdown
